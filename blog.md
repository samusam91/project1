Create visualizations to represent the distribution of skills among IT professionals. You can use bar charts, pie charts, or any other suitable visualizations. Ensure that the visuals are labeled appropriately.

python
Copy code
# Example: Bar chart of top programming languages
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.countplot(x='LanguageWorkedWith', data=df, order=df['LanguageWorkedWith'].value_counts().index[:10])
plt.title('Top 10 Programming Languages Among IT Professionals')
plt.xlabel('Programming Language')
plt.ylabel('Number of Respondents')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()

Include visualizations and tables that showcase the educational backgrounds of survey respondents. You could create a pie chart or a bar chart to represent the distribution of educational qualifications.

python
Copy code
# Example: Pie chart of educational qualifications
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
df['EdLevel'].value_counts().plot.pie(autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90)
plt.title('Educational Qualifications of IT Professionals')
plt.show()
Interpretation
Interpret the visualizations and tables you've created. Discuss any notable trends, patterns, or insights you've observed from the data. Relate your findings back to the business understanding and how the insights could inform strategic decisions.
